            <h3 id="q1">My neighbor’s dog barks constantly, what should I do?</h3>
            <p>The first action you should take is to speak with your neighbor. You may be able to resolve the problem by discussing it with your neighbor. Your neighbor may not be aware that their dogs' barking is disturbing you. Dogs often bark when their owners are not home. If for some reason you are unable to resolve the problem by speaking with your neighbor, you should contact the Office at xxx-xxx-xxxx and file a complaint.
              <br><br>
            The officer will either speak to the owners of the dogs or leave a written notice advising the owners that a complaint has been made. If the problem is not resolved, the Animal Care Officer may issue a citation. You will be asked to testify in court. You will need to keep a written log of the barking. Date, time, frequency and duration of the barking is necessary in order to determine if the barking is excessive and unwarranted.  A tape recording or video recording of the barking is also helpful.  You will be asked to provide Animal Care with documentation and recordings before a citation is issued.
            </p>

            <h3 id="q2">What can I do about loose dogs in my community?</h3>
            <p>
            Pet owners must not allow their pets to roam unrestrained. You may call Animal Care to remove the animal. Call the Office at xxx-xxx-xxxx and request to have your complaint investigated. If violations of the ordinances are found, a citation may be issued to the owner or the animal may be picked up. If the animal is picked up the owner pays fees and is issued a citation when redeeming the animal.
            <br><br>
            If you know the owner's name or other contact information, it is very helpful to provide this information when you call.
            </p>

            <h3 id="q3">How can I redeem my animal?</h3>
            <p>
              Owners of animals impounded by Animal Care Officers have the right to redeem their pet. Stray animals are held for five days. Pets wearing an identification tag are held for fourteen days. Owners of dangerous/vicious and nuisance animals may not redeem their pets unless authorized by the Department of Animal Care and certain conditions are met or until after a court hearing.
              <br><br>
              When redeeming your pet, please bring the following information with you:<br><br>

                1. Proof of your pet’s current license<br>
                2. Proof of current rabies vaccination<br>
                3. Verification that your pet has been spayed or neutered<br>
              <br>
              Animals will not be released without proof of vaccination and a current license. Owners of fertile pets are required to have their pets spayed or neutered before redemption. You must be at least eighteen years of age and have a valid picture I.D.
              <br>
              Owners of pets in violation of the animal ordinance will be issued appropriate citation(s).
              <br><br>
              Please contact us at xxx-xxx-xxxx to inquire about the redemption of your pet.
            </p>

            <h3 id="q4">What is the holding period for stray animals picked up by Animal Care?</h3>
            <p>
            Stray animals are impounded and held for five days when there is no County tag or other identification on the animal picked up. An animal wearing a County tag or other identifying tag will be held for fourteen days while efforts are made to contact the owner. Sick, injured, diseased or dangerous animals will not be held or placed in the population of other animals if it has been determined to be unsafe or unhealthy for personnel or other animals.
            </p>

            <h3 id="q5">Can I surrender my pet to Animal Care and is there a fee?</h3>
            <p>
            Owners are responsible for the care of their pets.  However, sick or injured pets may be surrendered to Animal Care and be picked up at the owner's request.  In Richland County there is no holding period for animals released by their owners. Be absolutely sure that you have made the right decision before calling Animal Care. There is no fee to release your animal to Animal Care. Owners can surrender their healthy pets directly to the Animal care Shelter after an initial consultation. To schedule your consultation, contact the office at xxx-xxx-xxxx.
            </p>

            <h3 id="q6">How many animals can I own?</h3>
            <p>
            Ther is no limit to the number of animals a resident can own.  However, all animals must be maintained in a safe and humane environment, and in a manner which does not contribute to a nuisance in the community. Each pet must be licensed.
            </p>

            <h3 id="q7">Can I adopt a pet from Animal Care?</h3>
            <p>
            No. Animals that are suitable for adoption can be adopted through other organizations.

            <h3 id="q8">Can I trap stray cats or dogs that come in my yard?</h3>
            <p>
            The County provides traps for citizens to catch stray dogs or cats. Due to the high demand for traps, it may be ten days or more before a trap is delivered. Only the use of humane traps are permitted.  Trapped cats may be returned to your area after they have been vaccinated, spayed/neutered, and ear-notched as part of the Community Cat Program.
            </p>

            <h3 id="q9">If I own a trap, can I call Animal Care to remove an animal?</h3>
            <p>
            Yes, Animal Care will remove the animal. Only the use of humane traps is permitted. The owner of the trap is responsible for resetting and baiting the trap.
            </p>

            <h3 id="q10">My pet has died; will Animal Care dispose of the animal?</h3>
            <p>
            Animal Care will dispose of a dog or cat. The owner must place the pet in a double garbage bag and leave it visible for removal. All other animal removals are the responsibility of the homeowner.
            </p>

            <h3 id="q11">Can Animal Care recommend a veterinarian?</h3>
            <p>
            Animal Care cannot recommend one veterinarian over another. We suggest that you ask friends and family to recommend a veterinarian to you with whom they have been satisfied. You may use this link to search for veterinarians in your area. Remember the veterinarians listed are not recommendations of the Animal Care Department.
            </p>

            <h3 id="q12">How can I report an abandoned or abused animal?</h3>
            <p>
            If you have knowledge of an animal that has been abandoned or abused by its owner feel free to contact the Office at: xxx-xxx-xxxx.

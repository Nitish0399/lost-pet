          <h2>Welcome to Pet Care!</h2>
          <p>Pets are part of our everyday lives and part of our families. They provide us with companionship but also with emotional support, reduce
          our stress levels, sense of loneliness and help us to increase our social activities and add to a childâ€™s self-esteem and positive emotional
          development.<br><br> In return, as responsible pet owners we need to ensure that our pets are kept healthy, fit, get nutritious food, love and
          affection and proper housing and care.
          Losing pets is a very stressful and painful for pet owners. Finding our lost pets is a time-taking and laborious task.<br><br>
          This website is designed for the pet owners who have lost their pet. You can search for your lost pet on this website in the lost pet records.
          We update our records immediately whenever we receive information about a lost pet being noticed by any citizen.<br><br>
          Hoping you find and get back your lost pet as soon as possible.</p>

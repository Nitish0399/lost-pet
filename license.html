        <h2>Licensing</h2>
        <p>
          Pet owners  are expected to provide their dogs or cats over the age of four months with a current rabies vaccination from a licensed veterinarian.
        </p>
        <h3>Some of the benefits of licensing your pet Include:</h3>
          <p>
          1. A pet license identifies and protects your dog or cat in case they get lost.<br>
          2. A pet wearing a County tag lets the Animal Care Officer know that this dog or cat belongs to someone.<br>
          3. A pet license ensures that animals are vaccinated against rabies.<br>
          4. The County staff will notify you immediately to redeem your pet.<br>
          5. Your pet will get a longer care period.<br>
          6. Found pets can be reunited quickly with their owner.<br>
          7. To report a found pet with a County Tag or other identification tag, please call (803) 576-2461 to report this. The information will be forwarded to Animal Care. If you would like the animal picked up, please inform the Customer Service Representative of this.
          <br><br>
          You may apply for a pet license by mail, in person, or online.
        </p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>The pet owner is required to show proof of rabies vaccination from a licensed veterinarian and proof of spay/neuter if applicable. Pet owners are also required to renew their license every year. Your pet license is good for one year. You will be notified by mail one month before your renewal date.
          <br><br>
        1. A statement from a licensed veterinarian that the animal, due to health reasons, could not withstand spay/neuter surgery.<br>
        2. Proof of participation in a nationally recognized conformation or performance event within the past twelve (12) months.<br>
        3. Any owner of a dog that is currently being used for hunting purposes and has properly been registered with a nationally recognized organization which sanctions hunting tests and/or field trials.  Such registration must be accompanied by proper documentation that will be required to receive this exemption.
        </p>
        <h3>Assistance Animals</h3>
        <p>Any owner of a dog which is trained to be an assistance dog for its owner shall be required to obtain an annual license but shall not be required to pay any license fee.  However, the owner still must provide proof of current rabies vaccinations.
        </p>
        <h3> Commercial Pet Breeder License Requirements</h3>
        <p>Individuals engaged or intending to engage in breeding as a business, occupation, or profession must obtain a commercial pet breeder license.  Animal Care shall conduct an annual inspection of the property to ensure that it is suitable for the applied license.

        <h2>Licensing</h2>
        <p>
          Pet owners  are expected to provide their dogs or cats over the age of four months with a current rabies vaccination from a licensed veterinarian.
        </p>
        <h3>Some of the benefits of licensing your pet Include:</h3>
          <p>
          1. A pet license identifies and protects your dog or cat in case they get lost.<br>
          2. A pet wearing a County tag lets the Animal Care Officer know that this dog or cat belongs to someone.<br>
          3. A pet license ensures that animals are vaccinated against rabies.<br>
          4. The County staff will notify you immediately to redeem your pet.<br>
          5. Your pet will get a longer care period.<br>
          6. Found pets can be reunited quickly with their owner.<br>
          7. To report a found pet with a County Tag or other identification tag, please call (803) 576-2461 to report this. The information will be forwarded to Animal Care. If you would like the animal picked up, please inform the Customer Service Representative of this.
          <br><br>
          You may apply for a pet license by mail, in person, or online.
        </p>

        <p>The pet owner is required to show proof of rabies vaccination from a licensed veterinarian and proof of spay/neuter if applicable.
